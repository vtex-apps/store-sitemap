# Store Sitemap

Our Store Sitemap app, `vtex.store-sitemap`, is responsible for automatically generating a `sitemap.xml` file of your VTEX IO Store. 
One of our appâ€™s important SEO features for cross-border stores is handling route internationalization. This guarantees that each route has its alternate link for the supported locale binding.

For more information about generating a sitemap, check the following sections.

:warning: *This app is available to stores using `vtex.edition-store@3.x` [Edition App](https://vtex.io/docs/concepts/edition-app/). To check which Edition App is installed on your account, run `vtex edition get`. If it's a different Edition, please [open a ticket](https://help-tickets.vtex.com/smartlink/sso/login/zendesk) to VTEX Support asking for the installation of the `vtex.edition-store@3.x` Edition App.*

## Configuration

1. Using your terminal and the [VTEX IO Toolbelt](https://vtex.io/docs/recipes/development/vtex-io-cli-installation-and-command-reference/), log into your account.
2. Run `vtex use {workspaceName} --production` to use a production workspace or [create a production workspace](https://vtex.io/docs/recipes/development/creating-a-production-workspace/)  from scratch.

:warning: *Remember to replace the values between the curly brackets according to your scenario.*

3. Run `vtex install vtex.store-sitemap@2.x` to install the Sitemap app.

:warning: *Before generating your store's sitemap, you might want to adjust if products, navigation, app and/or custom routes will be included in it or not. If that's the case, check the Advanced Configuration section for more information before proceeding any further.*

1. Open an API testing tool such as [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) and [create a basic request](https://learning.postman.com/docs/postman/sending-api-requests/requests/#creating-requests).
2. Use the `POST` method to send a request to the following URL: `https://{workspace}--{account}.myvtex.com/_v/bootstrap`. In the response body, you'll see a `json` containing information about the number of department, category and brand routes that were saved in the database.
3. Create a new request and use the `POST` method to send a request to the following URL: `https://{workspace}--{account}.myvtex.com/_v/generate-sitemap`. This means your sitemap will be available in some minutes, after being processed and saved on our database. Once the process is completed, a body response containing an `OK` in text format will be provided.

:information_source: *Keep in mind that the time taken to generate a sitemap is proportional to the number of products. For example, the average time to generate a sitemap for a store with 60k products is 30 minutes. For 5k products, the duration should be about 5 minutes.*

:warning: *If you attempt to send a new request to the Sitemap API while your store's sitemap generation is already taking place, the following message will be displayed:*

```
Sitemap generation already in place
Next generation available: <End-date>
```

*To make a force restart, add the `__force` query string at the end of the API URL, and send a new request. But, be aware that this will cancel the previous process.*

9. Check the sitemap generated for the current workspace you are working on by accessing `https://{workspace}--{account}.myvtex.com/sitemap.xml` on your browser. Notice that if your store is a cross-border one, you'll first see an index containing a website's sitemap for each locale.

:information_source: *Notice that different `.xml` files are generated according to their entity type (product, category, subcategory, user routes, brand and department) and that each `.xml` file supports a maximum of 5k routes.*

10. If you're happy with the results, run `vtex promote` to promote your workspace and to have your sitemap in your master workspace.

Once you promoted your workspace, no further actions are needed on your part: you are ready to check out your store's sitemap by accessing `https://{account}.myvtex.com/sitemap.xml` on your browser. 

### Advanced configuration

#### Managing routes

You can manage if you want to include product, navigation and/or apps routes in your sitemap or not. To do that, check the following step by step.

1. In your browser, access the admin of the VTEX account in which you are working using the Production workspace used in the step 2 of the Configuration section (`{workspaceName}--{accountName}.myvtex.com/admin`).
2. In the left menu, access Sitemap under CMS.
3. Enable or disable product, navigation, or app routes according to your scenario.

#### Enabling custom routes

If you have [custom pages](https://vtex.io/docs/recipes/templates/creating-a-new-custom-page/) configured in a `routes.json` file and want them to be included in your store's sitemap, add `isSitemapEntry=true` as a prop of the routes you want to include in the sitemap. Take the following example:

```
{
    "store.custom#about-us": {
      "path": "/about-us",
      "isSitemapEntry": true
  }
}
```

Once everything is set up, go back to the step 4 of the Configuration section.

## Modus Operandis

Once the app is deployed and installed in your account, your store will benefit from having a sitemap, which can lead to increased visibility of your site in search tools, such as Google.
